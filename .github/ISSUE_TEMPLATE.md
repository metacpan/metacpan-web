# Important, please read:

MetaCPAN's main developers want to focus on fixing bugs and improving the existing core system.

For this reason if you have a feature you would like to see added (there are load's we would love to have), please only open an issue _IF_ you are prepared to do the work to impliment it.

Otherwise please add it to our wishlist: https://github.com/CPAN-API/cpan-api/wiki/Wishlist and someone may get to it one day.

For more details on issues and contributing please see CONTRIBUTING.md (linked above).
