# About MetaCPAN

MetaCPAN is an open source search engine for the
Comprehensive Perl Archive Network ([CPAN](http://www.cpan.org/)), an ever growing archive of code and documentation for the Perl programming language.

MetaCPAN has two parts:

* [www.metacpan.org](https://www.metacpan.org), a front end to...
* [api.metacpan.org](http://api.metacpan.org/) the API

So
[https://www.metacpan.org/module/Moose](https://www.metacpan.org/module/Moose)
vs [http://api.metacpan.org/module/Moose](http://api.metacpan.org/module/Moose)

MetaCPAN is [a community effort](/about/contributors), with
all the code freely available on GitHub ([www](https://github.com/CPAN-API/metacpan-web), [api](https://github.com/CPAN-API/cpan-api)).

You can use and abuse the info you get from the API in any way you like.  If you don't like the search engine, you can even use the API to build your own CPAN search.  So, while the search site is the public face of MetaCPAN, its true value lies in an API which provides Perl hackers everywhere with the power to build their own complex search queries for extracting data from and about the CPAN.

# Where did you get that great logo?

Raul Matei won our [logo competition](http://entries.contest.metacpan.org/)
(sponsored by the [Enlightened Perl Organization](http://www.enlightenedperl.org/)) with his [entry](http://entries.contest.metacpan.org/2011/12/raul-matei.html)
and has been kind enough to also integrate it with the site.
