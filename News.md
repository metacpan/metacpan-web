------------------------------
Date: 2014-05-13T20:50:10

Jeffrey Thalhammer took the time this week to contribute dependency graphs to
MetaCPAN.  The graphs are hosted by [Stratopan](http://stratopan.com) and they
can be found on module and release pages under the "Reverse Dependencies" link.

Thanks very much to [THALJEF](https://metacpan.org/author/THALJEF) for
implementing this new feature.

In this news feed you can follow the development of the MetaCPAN site.
There is also an [Atom feed](/feed/news).

If you are interested in how the news feed itself was implemented, check out

MetaCPAN](http://perlmaven.com/adding-news-feed-to-metacpan)
