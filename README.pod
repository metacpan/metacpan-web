=head1 GETTING STARTED

Install Dist::Zilla using your preferred CPAN client:

 $ cpanm Dist::Zilla

Install the project dependencies:

 $ dzil listdeps | cpanm

Start server on port 5000

 $ plackup

The backend defaults to C<api.metacpan.org>. Running a local API server is optional and not required to hack on the front-end.
The address to the API user can be changed in the metacpan_web.conf file.
Ideally you would create a new file called C<metacpan_web_local.conf> that contains

 api localhost:5000

which will be loaded on top of the existing config file.

 $ plackup -p 5001 -r
 
This will use the API server at C<localhost:5000> and sets the port of the front-end to 5001.
The process will watch changes in the C</lib> directory.
