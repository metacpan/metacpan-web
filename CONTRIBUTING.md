### What is indexed?

 * Perl distributions which contain Perl packages.

### When are issues closed?

We want to keep the issue list manageable, so we can focus on what actually
needs fixing.  If you feel an issue needs opening again, please add a comment
explaining why it needs re-opening and we'll look at it again.

 * Issues will be closed and moved to [Wishlist](https://github.com/CPAN-API/cpan-api/wiki/Wishlist) if they are not actual bugs
 * Issues we think we have addressed will be closed
 * Issues we are not going to take any further action on without more information will be closed
